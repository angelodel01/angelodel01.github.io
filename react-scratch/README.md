***other versions***
My project is a reimplementation of a website that was written completely in vanilla javascript that can be found here: "https://angelodel01.github.io/"

for more information on the actual goals of the content of the website read the README of this project located at: "https://github.com/angelodel01/angelodel01.github.io"

I also implemented this website with create-react-app using locally downloaded modules instead of cdn links. The code (excluding the actual node_modules file) can found here: "https://github.com/angelodel01/react-demo"

***react advantages***
The difference between this "react-scratch" version and the original version is that this version uses the react framework.

The biggest benefit of using the react framework is that react will take most the burden of routing the website off of the programmer.
With the React router in use the programmer mostly just focuses on what they want their individual pages to look like, react will assist with all of the navigation between pages.
This means that the programmer doesn't have to concern themselves with functions for removing parts of pages and using React's JSX syntax they can even write much of the formatting for their page in blocks of HTML.  

To look at the exact layout and usage of the react router checkout the "./App.js" file

***react cdn advantages***
Using the react framework imported from cdn links means you have a very lightweight application. This version of my website was the easiest to implement. All you have to do is include the cdn's for the react dom and whichever auxiliary libraries you want in your index.html file, in the appropriate hierarchy.

Then similarly to the vanilla js version you just include your files in their appropriate hierarchy below your cdn links and now you can use any of the functionality of the react library.

***react cdn disadvantages***
Development with cdn links requires using a server unless you develop some kind of script to allow local development(I haven't figured out a way to do this). Since I developed my project using github pages this meant that much of my time spent building the web-app went to waiting for github to upload my changes to the website.
