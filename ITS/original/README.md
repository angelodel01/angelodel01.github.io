Angelo De Laurentis under John Morton for Cal Poly ITS

This is the original website built from individual html pages. It has been reimplemented as a single page app that can be found at: "https://angelodel01.github.io/"(the root of this project)

Since this is the original project it only has 2 auxiliary pages off of the home page; and was the quickest of all of the projects by far to implement.
