This website is a re-implementation of the vanilla javascript version that can be found at : "https://angelodel01.github.io/"

The difference between this "react-scratch" version and the original version is that this version uses the react framework.

The biggest benefit of using the react framework is that react will take most the burden of routing the website off of the programmer.
With the React router in use the programmer mostly just focuses on what they want their individual pages to look like, react will assist with all of the navigation between pages.
This means that the programmer doesn't have to concern themselves with functions for removing parts of pages and using React's JSX syntax they can even write much of the formatting for their page in blocks of HTML.  

To look at the exact layout and usage of the react router checkout the "./App.js" file
